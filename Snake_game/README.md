# Snake Game

## Overview

This project is a classic Snake Game implemented using Python's Turtle graphics. The objective of the game is to control a snake to eat food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (included with Python standard library)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Create the following files in the same directory as your main script**:

### `snake.py`
This file contains the `Snake` class which controls the snake's movement and behavior.

### `food.py`
This file contains the `Food` class which generates food at random positions for the snake to eat.

### `score_board.py`
This file contains the `Score_Board` class which tracks and displays the player's score.

### `data.txt`
This file is used to store the high score. Create a text file named `data.txt` in the same directory as your script and initialize it with `0`.

## How to Run

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. **Play the Game**: Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Eat the food to grow and score points. Avoid colliding with the walls and the snake's own body.

Enjoy your game!
